My goals as a web developer are fairly simple. I want to learn how to code so I can create beautiful websites. However in which avenue is what I have been debating since starting Bloc.

When I first started at Bloc, I had a goal of just getting a job with some digital agency in Portland, OR. However since then, a few things have changed.

I have always felt a calling to work for non-profits. I have never been motivated by financial gains. While I do understand web developers can make good money, it wasn’t the reason I got into this. I have done work with non-profits before and continue doing freelance design and photography for a few, but would love to offer up web developing services to those who need it.

So now my goal is to have a job as a web developer with a non-profit or an agency that does work for them.

One thing I have noticed, most of them do not have good websites and most cannot afford well designed websites. I would like to make that happen for the non-profits who need it.

A well designed website has so many benefits and I believe that organizations that are helping people should have the best out there. Showing how they are helping people and how others can get involved is only the stepping stone for their organizations.

Accepting donations, organizing events, and the ease of upkeep is essential for non-profits. So creating this kind of system for them to use would be an amazing accomplishment. Now I know they could just go and use Square Space or some other DIY hosting service, but I think those will still lack the services and heart that the non-profits need.

Also being apart of difference the non-profits are making  would be the biggest upside, I would want to offer my other services to the non-profits as well. Including graphic design and photography, a full suite to help them tell the untold stories of forgotten people.

I know its the cliché joke in the web developer world to want to make it a better place, but thats exactly what I want to do.

I have a long way to go before I can start but I am determined and hopeful of getting there. I already have a few connections with some non-profits and even a digital agency that I may start doing freelance graphic design work for. The web developing part will only be icing on the cake.
