My name is Steven Mills and I am a full-stack web developer / designer hybrid, currently living in the Charlotte, NC area with my wife and two siberian huskies.

Most of my background has been in photography and graphic design, where I have worked with a variety of clients, from publications, non-profits and large corporations.

I recently finished my Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp with [Bloc.io](http://bloc.io), where I have learned so much about web developing. I also just recently started an internship with a local web marketing and advertising company called, [Search and Be Found](https://searchandbefound.com/).

Once I finish up this internship I hope to land a full-time position as a junior web developer where I can continue learning and growing in this amazing field.

Thanks for checking out my page!
