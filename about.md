My name is Steven Mills and I am a full-stack web developer / designer hybrid, currently living in the Charlotte, NC area.

I will soon be finishing up my Full-Stack Bootcamp with Bloc, where I have learned so much about web developing. I also just recently started an internship with a local marketing and advertising company called, Search and Be Found.

Once I finish up this internship I hope to land a full-time position as a junior web developer creating beautiful websites made with simple and clean code.

Thanks for checking out my page!
