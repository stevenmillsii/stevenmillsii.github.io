  <h1 class="post-title">Finding Web Development</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>I’ve always had an interest in computers and overall technology. When I was a kid my favorite stores were Best Buy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_City">Circuit City</a> and Comp USA. Always dreaming of the day I’d have my own computer, but, back then most families only had one computer.</p>

<p>I remember the day we brought home our first family computer. I believe I was around 7 years old, it was an HP loaded with Windows ’95. I was so fascinated by how it worked and wanted to know everything. However, it took me a while before my dad would let me play around on it.</p>

<p>It started with the preloaded games. Ski, Solitaire, Pinball, Minesweeper, and Chips Challenge (<em>my favorite</em>). I would spend hours playing these games and then I found my way to Paint and creating spray painted masterpieces, at least I thought so.</p>

<p>Eventually my dad let me set up my own AOL account and I will never forget hearing those beautiful words, “You’ve got mail!” Only to find out it was the default email you’d receive after setting up your account, but I didn’t care, it was amazing.</p>

<p>As I got a little older, I somewhat forgot about computers and started playing more video games. It wasn’t until middle school in my first computer class I learned about all the history and how to officially start using one. I started to learn the MS Office Suite, one keystroke at a time. At home I started to experiment more, chatting in AOL chat rooms, talking with friends on AIM. I could spend all day on the computer. But still didn’t find real value in using one.</p>

<p>In the 10th grade, I signed up for a Visual Communications class and I found it. We each got to use a Mac Pro and got to learn the Adobe Suite. I was amazed and knew from then on what I wanted to do. Graphic Design.</p>

<p>After high school, I decided to go to school at a local community college for Digital Design. Where I learned more in depth the full Adobe Suite at the time, as well as some typography and art classes. There was even a Flash class (<em>back when everybody was building websites with flash</em>). Turns out, I hated it. I just couldn’t understand it and after that vowed to never learn web developing / design.</p>

<p>Now, fast forward almost 10 years later. I am nearing the end of my 20s and have a job as a graphic designer, but still wanting to learn more. I decided to tap into myself and figure out what would be the best skill for me to learn. Turns out, web developing was going to make a come back. I decided to look into a coding bootcamp after hearing a friend of mine talk about.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of searching I decided to sign up with Bloc. It’s been a wild ride since that first meeting with my mentor, but now I can’t imagine ever turning back.</p>
