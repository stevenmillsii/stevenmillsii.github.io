This time last week I was preparing to go in for a job interview for an amazing company here in Charlotte, NC.

And now, a week later, I am ecstatic to announce that I accepted the position. Starting November 15th, I will be a Junior Web Designer at [The Idea People](http://www.theideapeople.com/). It still hasn’t hit me yet that this is really happening, I have signed the offer letter and its all official, but I am still somewhat in disbelief.

For the past year I have been working through a coding bootcamp, where I have learned full stack web developing. What I a lot of people didn’t see was my struggle through this journey. I almost gave up multiple times, one time came close to switching over to a web design path.

In the first meeting with my coding mentor during bootcamp, he told me something that I never would forget. That I had a great eye for design and that’s what will get me hired over other developers.

Well turns out, he was pretty much right, except I didn’t get hired for a developer position, it was for a design position. Which looking back now, through all the hard times I had during the bootcamp, it makes since that I would end up doing design.

I have always been and will always be more passionate about design and making things look good than the functionality. However, I will say, that I believe if it wasn’t for learning to code, I wouldn’t have gotten the design position.

Knowing basic frontend developing skills I think is essential for a web designer in today’s market.

Everything has led up to this moment, all the work I have put in, all the random jobs and experiences, I believe has prepared me for this exact line of work. And I can’t wait to jump in and get started on November 15th.
