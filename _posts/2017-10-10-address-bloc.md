Address Bloc was the first project in the backend development section of my coding bootcamp. This project taught the basics of Ruby by building a address book that you can run from your terminal.

I really enjoyed this project because of simplicity of the Ruby language as compared to JavaScript.

Below are a few screenshots of the app, you can also view the code on my [github](https://github.com/stevenmillsii/address-bloc).
