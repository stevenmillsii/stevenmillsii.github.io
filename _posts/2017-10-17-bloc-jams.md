Bloc Jams was my first project while attending the online full stack web development mentorship, Bloc.io. The purpose of this project was to build a music player app similar to Spotify.

I started this project by building from scratch with HTMl, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript. Once finished I refactored the code to use AngularJS to simplify the process of adding more music to the app.

Below are a few screenshots of the app, you can also view the code on my [github](https://github.com/stevenmillsii/bloc-jams-angular).
