I started the Full-Stack Web Development Track in October of 2016. I was so excited to be learning a new skill, but had a lot of fears and worries going into it. As I said in my ‘Finding Web Development’ post, I didn’t think I’d ever be going into this field after attempting to learn it in college.

The first week went great. I loved learning HTML and CSS, because of my design background I felt right at home creating visually. It wasn’t nearly as hard as I thought it was going to be. However, once the checkpoints to learn command line and GTI came around, I started having doubts.

That was when my struggles started. Command Line and GIT were extremely foreign to me and grasping the concept of GIT took a while for me to understand. But my mentor helped me right along, making some of the concepts more simple to understand. After I finished with those checkpoints, I thought the hard part was over for the Front-end module. But was I so wrong.

Next up, JavaScript, the beast of a language that will forever stump me. The ironic thing is that I am a very analytical and logical thinking person. But JavaScript puts logical thinking on a whole other level. However I do enjoy the challenge, and there is nothing like the feeling of figuring it out on your own.

About a quarter of the way into Bloc, I did hit a wall. I was done and came extremely close to quitting and getting my refund. I became so frustrated with myself for not understanding it. I talked with my wife about it one night for a while, discussing the pros and cons of quitting or continuing. And I decided to keep pushing through. I figured the cliché truth was right, nothing is easy, but you still have to work hard for it if you want it.

I kept on reminding myself of my goals and what I wanted out of learning web developing and there were just too many pros. After taking a break for a week from Bloc, I headed into the Angular JS section and actually really enjoyed learning Angular. Parts of it just clicked for me and become fun to work on the checkpoints and assignments. I have re-found my passion and drive.

Next up is starting my portfolio and then onto the BlocChat project, the last one of the Front-end module. I have all sorts of feelings nearing the end of this module. Feelings of excitement and anxiety. The progress assessment is what keeps me from going onto the Back-end module and the last one I did I had to re-do once before passing. However I am staying hopeful for this one.
