JavaScript is not my forte. I have struggled with it since day one and almost a year later I still struggle with it.

Now that I am currently in an internship and starting to use it more and more, I find the need to become better at it. Thus giving me the urge and _desire_ to become a **JavaScript Ninja**.

Over the next however many days it takes I am going to go through the book, _Eloquent JavaScript_ very slowly, even going through concepts I already understand to further my understanding and hoping to learn more.

Once I finish this journey I hope to be able to write JavaScript more efficiently and with a better understanding of what my code is actually doing.

The quote at the beginning of _Eloquent JavaScript_ sums this process up perfectly,
<br>
<br>

> “Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below.”<br>
<br>
>  -Master Yuan-Ma, _The Book of Programming_

<br>

For anybody reading this post wondering even what **JavaScript** is, here is a quick history introduction.

It was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages. It has since been made to use in modern web applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action. It is also used more traditionally in websites to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.<br>

 _Also, an important note, JavaScript and Java have nothing to do with each other._

This was a short post, but there will be more to come as I will try to write posts about what I am learning through this book. You should also check it out for yourself, you can buy a [physical copy](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-2nd-Ed-Introduction/dp/1593275846/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506282651&sr=8-1&keywords=eloquent+javascript) or you can read the [online version](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) for free.
