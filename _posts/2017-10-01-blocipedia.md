Blocipedia was one of my favorite projects during the coding bootcamp. The purpose was to build a Wikipedia replica. This was my third project using Ruby and I felt like I learned the most while doing this one.

To create this project I used Ruby and Rails, as well as a few Ruby Gems to add the functionality of accepting payments, handling the user sign-up and servers. These tools included; Heroku, Devise, Redcarpet and Stripe.

Within this web application you can sign up for a free account, upgrade to a premium account or become an admin. Depending on your account level you can create, edit and delete wikis.

Below are a few screenshots of the app, you can also view the code on my [github](https://github.com/stevenmillsii/blocipedia).
