…Or technically first three days at my new job. I started Wednesday, November 15th at The Idea People, my position, Junior Web Designer.

Since I knew I was starting this position a few weeks ago, my life plan has somewhat changed from what it was a few months ago. While I was in coding bootcamp I had these aspirations of becoming a full-stack developer master. However, something inside me knew that wasn’t who I really was or what I truly cared about.

Now, I know what I’ve known all along and back to my past dream of becoming one of the worlds best designers, (or at least a decent one).

I love design, all types of design. Industrial, architecture, interior, graphic, web, interaction, etc… I notice these things everywhere I go, everything I interact with I always question why it was designed the way it was and how could it be better. I am naturally always trying to improve processes to be more efficient and aesthetically pleasing.

My first three days as junior web designer have been incredible. So far I have worked on logos, letterhead, web banners, and obviously desktop and mobile web designs. This is the work I truly enjoy, this is the work I am constantly trying to get better at.

My hope is that I can spend as many years as I can at The Idea People and grow as a designer, learn as much as I can and eventually start to help other designers with their careers and bettering themselves.

This is what I am passionate about and what keeps me up at night. I can’t wait to see what other exciting projects I will get to work on and learn from.

Many thanks to Bill, Jay and Darrell at The Idea People for giving me this opportunity and letting me join your team.
